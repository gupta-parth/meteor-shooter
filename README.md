# Meteor Shooter
## Overview
Meteor Shooter is a 2D game created using Python's pygame module. This game served as my first project into game development and was created during my junior year of highs school. 
The objective of the game is to survive the wave of enemy ships and meteors. Enemies will attack the player by shooting lasers and this will deal a certain amount of damage to the
player health. Similarly, the meteors can deal damage once the player hits them. The player has the benefit of shooting lasers and destroying enemy ships to gain points and survive.
The game progressively gets harder as more and more enemy ships and meteors starts appearning in waves.
